# Fustr attempt
git clone https://github.com/tijeco/FUSTr.git
bash FUSTr/setup_docker.sh ./Transcriptomes/ # had to edit the setup file and drop the pip installation as that was causing errors with python version (and pip already installed)
docker run -it fustr /bin/bash
FUSTr -d ./data -t <number_of_threads>

what do output files look like?
