# How to Babbage

Here we are going to try and work through some basics of the terminal and some tasks you might need to do.

---
##  <!--fit-->  Stuff you see that looks like this:
``` 
codey stuff 
more codey stuff 
```

Means you enter it into the terminal, or that's what comes out


---
# Baby steps
## _WHERE AM I!_ 
```pwd``` = print working directory

```
pwd
/c/Users/Seth/Documents/GitHub
```

---
## Where do I go?

``` cd somedirectory ``` cd = change directory

``` cd .. ``` : up a directory

---
  # Make friends with TAB 

  Start typing while you are changing directory and hit ```TAB``` to have the terminal try and autocomplete


---

# Make a testFile or three

Make an empty file with not-at-all-creepyly-named command

``` 
touch testFile.txt
touch testFile2.txt
touch testFile.tab
```
---
Put something in the file 

``` 
echo 'testeyteddyeyesty' >> testFile.txt
echo 'blahblahblah' >> testFile.txt

echo 'plerplerggggkl;jkljkl;' > testFile2.txt
echo 'nimbynimby' > testFile2.txt
```
---

How did that work 

```
head testFile.txt
```

```
head testFile2.txt
```

```>``` is not the same as ```>>```

```>``` sends it to the file and replaces the whole file.
```>>``` appends to the file (does not replace the file)

```cat``` catenates üê±
```cat testFile.txt testFile2.txt > comboFile.txt```

---
# Looking at stuff

```head``` shows the top of a file
```tail``` is the bottom (surprise!). 
```less``` shows you more :roll_eyes: (type ```q``` to exit)

---

What's here? list = ls

```
ls
```
ooh, that's kinda ugly

try ```ls -l``` (-l is the 'flag' for long)
try ```ls -al``` (... -a all)
try ```ls -alh``` (... -h human readable)
try ```ls -alht``` (... -t ordered by time)
try ```ls *.txt``` (just the .txt files)

---
# Moving and ~~shaking~~ copying

OK, you made a mistake and want to rename something

```
mv oldname newname
```
```mv``` = move, eg:
```
mv testFile.tab testTab.tab
ls
```
---
# Moving and ~~shaking~~ copying
Let's be safe and copy (```cp```) a file we want to mess around with
```
cp testTab.tab backupTab.tab
ls
``` 

---
# Removing files  ‚ö†Ô∏è üí• ‚ò¢Ô∏è ‚ò†Ô∏è ü¶• ü¶ô ü¶Ñ üñêÔ∏è
Warning: terminal will do what you tell it. Even if that means delete everything. Proceed with caution and when in doubt test first. eg to come 

```rm``` = remove
``` 
rm backupTab.tab
```

You can use wildcards (eg. *.tab would be all .tab files) but it's dangerous. Dont' go throwing wildcards around until you are confident

---
If you want to use wildcards with deleting (rm) test first eg:

```ls *.tab``` does that list only the files you want to remove? If so, go ahead and replace ```ls``` with ```rm```. If not, stop!

---

## <!--fit --> Connect to the server 
``` ssh barribeau@the.ip.address.from.jon ``` 

---
**Tips and tricks**
Open hidden file for ssh configuration in nano (text editor) 
``` nano ~/.ssh/config```

add the following (but with your deets obv):

``` 
Host babbage
        HostName the.ip.address.from.jon
        User barribeau

Host euler
        HostName the.euler.address.from.richard
        User seth
```

exit by typing ```cntrl+x``` and saying yes you'll save (```y enter```)

---


Now you can connect with easier to remember:

``` ssh babbage ```

# Tadaaaah  :1st_place_medal:

--- 
## Getting stuff onto the server
Transfer with ```scp```

with the shortcut
``` 
scp testFile.txt babbage:path/to/where/you/want/it/to/go
```

without the shortcut
``` 
scp testFile.txt barribeau@the.ip.address.from.jon:path/to/where/you/want/it/to/go
```

--- 
## Getting stuff off the server
Transfer with ```scp```

with the shortcut
``` 
scp babbage:path/to/where/your/file/is/testFile.txt path/to/put/it/on/your/computer
```

without the shortcut
``` 
scp barribeau@the.ip.address.from.jon:path/to/where/your/file/is/testFile.txt path/to/put/it/on/your/computer
```

---
## Stuff that takes a long time

Use a ```screen``` . Screens allow you to start something and run it in the background. You can then connect to it later. This is very useful because
* Sometimes connections suck and you get cut off. 
* You may need to use your computer for other stuff.
* Life happens
* Use ```screen``` it will save you tears and years.

---
make a new screen
```
screen -S myNewScreen
```
you now have a new screen running and you start your things.
To exit the screen you type ```cntrl+a``` then ```cntrl+d``` and you will be out of the screen.

To reconnect you just type
```
screen -r myNewScreen
```

When you are done, type ```exit``` to finish that screen. 

---

## Downloading stuff

```wget``` or ```curl``` will download files. 

e.g. you want to get [this data](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/SRX9017992[accn]) from the SRA. You then click through to the [RUN ID](https://trace.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Traces/sra/?run=SRR12527928) and see the download link under data access.

```
wget https://sra-download.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/traces/sra0/SRR/012234/SRR12527928
```

---
# Oh no, that's going to take for ever! Cancel!

```cntrl+c``` ‚¨ÖÔ∏è you may use this a lot

get rid of that partial file
```rm SRR12527928```

---
## Decompressing stuff
Downloaded files are usually compressed in one way or another. Which means you have to extract them. Which I always forget how to do. Remember your Google-fu

if it's ```*.zip``` then, you ```gunzip randoFile.zip``` 
If it's some flavour of tgz/tar.gz/etc... Look it up but it will look a bit like this

```
tar -zxvf randoFile.tar.gz
```
---

It may seem scary, but you've got this
